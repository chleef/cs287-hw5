Part 1:

1. What does the scatterplot highlight? 
Data set is skewed to smaller points - people's bills tend to be smaller.
As Total Bill Amount increases, tips tend to go up - but there is a larger variation in tip amount.

2. What piece of information would make the scatterplot more useful? Explain. 
More demographic information on the bill payers could be interesting - sex, age, etc.
Which meal these bills come from to see if there is a difference in lunch and dinner.
A trendline could help.

3. Are there other variables that would be interesting to put into a scatterplot? Why? 
Could be interesting to do party size vs. tip percentage.
Could also look at time on the x-axis and then either total bill or tip percentage.
